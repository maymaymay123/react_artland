# ArtLand Application

## Introduction

What is art to you? Art to me is creating something without words, it is a form of communication.
It is a fundamental component of the human experience reflecting the world and the time in which we live. 
The reason I created this app is for the capture of visual inspiration.
Looking at the wide range of master pieces throughout history is a great way to stimulate our sensitivity to art appreciation.

I used the API from The MET Museum, it presents over 5,000 years of art from around the world for everyone to experience and enjoy.

On the home page, you can see the highlight of the week. If you are interested in any of these images, you can click onto it, find out their art title, artist name, year of production. I included the “find out more…” link, because MET API doesn’t provide description for each of the art pieces.

If you would like to search using your own keyword, you can click on the magnifying glass and search.

On the Classification page, you can see there are a few categories listed on the top, I categorized based on MET’s department IDs. If you are interested in e.g. Asian art, you can click on “Asian art” and get some ideas regarding Asian art. 

On the Inspiration page, this is the default filter. So let’s say if you want to know more about fashion, just click on “Fashion”, you will see the relevant displays.

On the Contact page, if you have any issue with the webpage, feel free to contact the admin.
